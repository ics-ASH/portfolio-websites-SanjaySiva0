I had a math and science test today. I did pretty well because of the hours I spent studying. After school I went to play soccer with my friends, we usually play twice a week. I also worked on Github a little bit, tweaking my background and other little details

I had no homework from all my classes and I was caught up in all my work. With all this free time, I decided to spend some time with my brother . We were talking about my future like which Uni I hope to attend. He’s in his second year of university so he gave me some advice on what university and other important things.

Today I had my second basketball game, at the start, I was bench but eventually coach let me in. Surprisingly I dropped 19 with 7 assists on the first game which we won. The second game was really close but my teammate Byran managed to hit a game winner. Third we lost but I was happy we made it that far. At the end of the day i ended up going to the restaurant with my family and feel asleep on the car ride home.

On Sundays i usually just stay home and play video games but today I decided to go to my friend Jamie’s house. We talked a little about soccer and then went to McDonald to meet up with out other friends. After that I had to  go home and work a little on github because I realized I was a little behind and then went to bed early so I can get ready for school tomorrow.
