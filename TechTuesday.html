<body>Raspberry pis are like computers that can fit into the palm of your hand. Contrary to the computers of the past this one is mini. It offers a nice gateway into the rabbit hole of programming, and technology that so many love. Raspberry Pis are designed to promote and nurture growth in science education and technology. The main things with a raspberry pi is how easy and simple they are to use. They offer a user friendly interface that aids learning and growth. The Pi is a great tool for education in the field of computer sciences. By using the hands on computing interface. Sometimes traditional computers can be expensive and not very afoardble to people but raspberry pie has a more friendly budget. There is no limit to raseryy pie you can use whatever space you need. Mac and Pc also have the ability to run raspberry pie you just need a microSD card and a microSD card reader. Once raspberry pie is installed alot of projects awaits for example Home Server.

<body>Computer hardware is is a real thing compared to software. Hardware is what makes computers and things of the such run. Software is not a hard real thing it is defined as the programs that are installed on the computers. Examples of different hardwares are motherboards, computer processing software(CPU), random access memory(RAM), Storage Drive (HDD or SSD), graphic processing unit(GPU), and keyboard and mouse. Your computers motherboard is the hub that connects all the other pieces of hardware. The CPU is there to help your computer process different types of data. RAM and CPU work closely together to keep the computer running at a good rate. These are some of the most important parts of a computer.  A graphics processing unit is when Gpu processes vast amounts of praphical data  and has a dedicaed graphics card that s connected with the mother board using an expansion slot. What is a PSU (power supply unit) a psu takes electricity from an external power source or like a lptop and with this power it passes it to the motherboard to power cenrtan hardware components. how do you see what hardware your computer has? to check what type of compnents your laptop has you can use a crucial systme scanner or a crucial system selector. You can also check your hardware through setting or by physically chekcing the labels on the hard ware. THE END</body>
