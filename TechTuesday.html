<body>Raspberry pis are like computers that can fit into the palm of your hand. Contrary to the computers of the past this one is mini. It offers a nice gateway into the rabbit hole of programming, and technology that so many love. Raspberry Pis are designed to promote and nurture growth in science education and technology. The main things with a raspberry pi is how easy and simple they are to use. They offer a user friendly interface that aids learning and growth. The Pi is a great tool for education in the field of computer sciences. By using the hands on computing interface. Sometimes traditional computers can be expensive and not very afoardble to people but raspberry pie has a more friendly budget. There is no limit to raseryy pie you can use whatever space you need. Mac and Pc also have the ability to run raspberry pie you just need a microSD card and a microSD card reader. Once raspberry pie is installed alot of projects awaits for example Home Server. Media Center, Retropie Arcade, Smart Mirror, Home Automation. In conclusion, learning about computers goes a long way Raspberry pie has no limit and you could never stop learning about it.</body>

<a href = "https://www.crucial.com/articles/pc-builders/what-is-computer-hardware ">Article 2</a>
<br/>
<body>Computer hardware is is a real thing compared to software. Hardware is what makes computers and things of the such run. Software is not a hard real thing it is defined as the programs that are installed on the computers. Examples of different hardwares are motherboards, computer processing software(CPU), random access memory(RAM), Storage Drive (HDD or SSD), graphic processing unit(GPU), and keyboard and mouse. Your computers motherboard is the hub that connects all the other pieces of hardware. The CPU is there to help your computer process different types of data. RAM and CPU work closely together to keep the computer running at a good rate. These are some of the most important parts of a computer.  A graphics processing unit is when Gpu processes vast amounts of praphical data  and has a dedicaed graphics card that s connected with the mother board using an expansion slot. What is a PSU (power supply unit) a psu takes electricity from an external power source or like a lptop and with this power it passes it to the motherboard to power cenrtan hardware components. how do you see what hardware your computer has? to check what type of compnents your laptop has you can use a crucial systme scanner or a crucial system selector. You can also check your hardware through setting or by physically chekcing the labels on the hard ware. THE END</body>

<br/>
<body>Open AI is a wonderful tool that has become available to us through ChatGPT and other Ai programs. Many american officials say that we should not halt the progress of AI and let it flourish and grow. 72% of american voters say that they want AI to slow down and that the progress scares them. With the upcoming elections in the United States of America, AI has to be a serious topic of discussion. AI is growing at a massive rate and his seems to make some people very excited about the upcoming possibilities of what we can do with AI. The possibilities are endless. This seems to frighten some people as they are scared of what they dont know and understand. The possibilities that this tool gives us are both scary and wondrous. 82 percent of americans voters dont trust ai companies. Meta have said theyre eaer to be regulated but they continue to preptutate serious harms. OpenAI has also came out and said they want regulation. Time is of the essence start by vigorosuly enforcing exisiting laws. 58 percent of voters — including a plurality of Republicans — want the federal government to thoroughly regulate AI. 76 percent of voters want AI-generated images to be required to contain proof they were generated by a computer.65 percent of voters support requiring advanced AI models to demonstrate they are safe before they are released, while just 11 percent oppose that policy.

<a href = "https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain">Article 4</a>
<br/>
<body>A system in which a record of transactions, especially those made generally in CryptoCurrency, is maintained across computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. Some benefit of Blockchain is greater trust, with blockchain, as a member of a members-only network, you can rest assured that you are receiving the best and most accurate data. The most important thing is nothing can delete or revoke a transaction. They are recorded permanently.  They also have greater security as there is a consensus on data accuracy. Each block is connected to the ones before and after it.  It is also super efficient as there is a distributed ledger that is shared among the members of a network. Time-wasting records reconciliations are eliminated.  A public blockchain is a chain where anyone can join and participate for example bitcoin, some drawbacks that come with it might include the substantial computational power that is required, little or no privacy for transactions, and weak security. You may be asking what is the difference between blockchain and Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an unregulated, digital currency that uses blockchain technology as its transaction ledger. Some use of blockchain is Tracing seafood from the moment it is caught. Similar to a public blockchain network, a private blockchain network operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer model. Companies that install a permissoned blockchain network also typically install a private blockchain. The upkeep of a blockchain might be divided among several groups. Who can submit transactions or access the data is decided by these pre-selected organizations.

<a href = "https://formant.io/robotics/">Article 5</a>
<br/>
<body>To put it simply robotics is the combination of science, engineering, and tech to design, construct, operate, and utilize these machines which are programmed to replicate, substitute, and assist humans in completing several different tasks. Robots have a history, dating back to ancient Greece. The first digitally operated and programmable robot emerged in the middle of the twentieth century. Robotics quickly took over the key industries: such as automotive manufacturing. The first robot prototypes were the early spot welding robot prototypes used in General Motors facilities in 1961. Throughout the years, robotics has developed exponentially to benefit many industries throughout the world. Robots are used all around the globe, from college clubs to construction to Fortune 100s. People and companies are harnessing the great power of robotics more than ever before. To prove this the value of the Global Robotics Market is rising to around 38 billion dollars CAD. AMRs are a type of robot called Autonomous Mobile Robots. They use high-tech sensors, AI, and machine learning. They can support many tasks, such as delivering items, carrying out safety and security checks, inventory automation, rescue missions, and crop harvesting. Another cool thing AMRs can do is space exploration. Robots help construction teams with autonomous technologies that support efficiency and accuracy it also ensures there is safety on the job suites. Robotics has become a very cost-effective type of method for farmers and agriculture businesses to meet the very fast and growing global demand. The energy has turned to robots for inspecting and monitoring security in key sites. The healthcare industry has used robots for the delivery and dispensing of medication and they can also perform more complex jobs sometimes they are used for surgery or rehabilitation and they are mostly used for diagnostics. Manufacturers were the first to adopt robotics they used it to increase the workforce efficiently and to offload more heavy and dangerous tasks. Robotics made a significant impact on shipping and delivery as they can use bots to complete last-mile delivery. Drones are starting to be used and they are eventually going to be used more often. IN recent years mining companies are starting to use robotics to look for closed or abandoned mines. There is a very big future for robotics as there will be more than 12 million robotic units worldwide in 2020. The industry is on a very bright path they are going to keep growing and sooner or later robots will take all human jobs.
